[Prof. Evan Speight](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/evan-speight),

for generously sharing their course materials.
We also thank [Prof. Milos Gligoric](https://www.ece.utexas.edu/people/faculty/milos-gligoric)
for the curriculum-design discussion.

This course took inspiration from several open-courses, including:
* [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education (MIT)](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
* [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard)](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
* [Standard C++ Programming (Stanford)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106l/)

We'd like to thank all the people who developed these great courses and
were willing to share them publicly.
We highly encourage you to check out their course materials as a complementary source.
