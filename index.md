## Course Overview
Welcome to "ECE 312: Software Design and Implementation I,"
where we learn how to think like a programmer and write beautiful software.
In this course, you will learn time-tested programming languages like C and C++.
You will learn various algorithms and data structures to
write efficient and organized programs .
You will also develop skills to comprehend, participate in,
and manage a moderately-sized software projects.

### Prerequisites
- ECE/EE/BE 306 or 306H (grade \>=C-)
- ECE/EE 319K or 319H (grade \>=C-)

## Course Requirements
The expectations for all students in this course are as follows:

**Class Attendence**: You will *physically* attend every class and
actively participate in class discussions.
Questions are always welcomed during and after the lecture.
We will do a lot of interactive coding during lectures throughout the semester,
<u>so please remember to bring a charged laptop to follow along</u>.
Pop quizzes may be given during lectures and will count towards your participation grade.
Although lectures will be recorded and shared afterwards for you to review,
it's not a substitution for physical attendance.

*Policy*: You can miss at most two lectures without grade penalty.
Please reach out to the instructor if you need special accomendation.

**Programming Assignments**: Programming looks easy until you try it yourself.
Therefore, you will complete 5 small programming assignments and
2 large multi-week programming assignments.
These assignments will make up a significant portion of your grade and
also help you practice for the exams.

*Late Policy*: You will have cumulatively 48 hours to be late throughout the semester.
For example, if the assignment is due on Monday 1pm and you submitted it on Monday 9pm,
then you used 8 out of the 48-hour quota.
For every extra late hour, 2% of your grade for that assignment will be deducted until reaching 0.
We round up the hour.

**Homework Assignments**: You will complete homework assignments
to reinforce what you have learned.
Homework assignments will be concentrated around the algorithm and data structure portion of the course.

*Late Policy*: Same as the programming assignments.
<u>Note that the 48-hour quota is shared between programming and homework assignments</u>.

**Recitation Quizzes**: You will complete an *in-person* quiz at most recitation sessions.
These are simple quizzes that help you refresh what you learned since the last week.

**Exams**: You will take two in-class exams.
Make-up tests will not be offered without a note from a doctor explicitly
stating you are unable to take the test on the assigned day.
Note this is not the same thing as a slip from UT Health
Services showing you simply went to the doctor.

## Grading

* 3%: Class participation (includes attendance, in-class discussion, and pop quizzes)
* 3%: Recitation quizzes
* 9%: Homework assignments
* 30%: Programming assignments
* 25%: Midterm exam
* 30%: Final exam

### Grade Breaks
| Grade | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D | D- | F |
|-------|---|----|----|---|----|----|---|----|----|---|----|---|
| Range | [94, 100] | [90, 94) | [87, 89) | [84, 87) | [80, 84) | [77, 80) | [74, 77) | [70, 74) | [67, 70) | [64, 67) | [60, 64) | [0, 60) |


## Academic Integrity
The university provides a Canvas [page](https://utexas.instructure.com/courses/1377522) with policies and resources relevant to all courses. You can refer to it as you navigate your time at UT. This course also has the following additional policies.

### Collaboration with Others
TL;DR: You are allowed (and even encouraged) to discuss high-level ideas with others,
but you cannot share your code with them.
Downloading code from the Internet or from students who have taken the course before
also counts as code sharing and it's not allowed.
Here are some examples (though not an exhaustive list):

#### Allowed
<ul>
<li class="allowed">Discuss the software architecture of the project</li>
<li class="allowed">Discuss the algorithmic strategty to the problem</li>
<li class="allowed">Provide insights on common reasons for SEGFAULTs</li>
<li class="allowed">Share environment configuration and setup (e.g., VSCode and SSH configurations)</li>
</ul>

#### Prohibited
<ul>
<li class="blocked">Share your code with other students</li>
<li class="blocked">Use code written by students from prior years</li>
<li class="blocked">Help other students debug their program line-by-line</li>
</ul>

### Use of AI Tools
Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and Claude have become widespread.
Hype aside, these tools are indeed transforming the way we retrieve and process information.
It is therefore crucial to learn how to effectively use these tools in our research---while maintaining academic integrity and avoiding intellectual dishonesty.
The general policy for this course regarding the use of AI tools is that **it is acceptable to retrieve and process retrieved information, but not to create original content**.
Here are some examples (though not an exhaustive list):

#### Allowed
<ul>
<li class="allowed">Clarify a confusing concept (but please be aware of hallucination/fabrication)</li>
<li class="allowed">Find and summarize related documentation</li>
<li class="allowed">Learn instructions about how to use a given tool (VSCode, GCC, Bash, Makefile, etc)</li>
</ul>

#### Prohibited
<ul>
<li class="blocked">Upload the course quizzes to AI tools</li>
<li class="blocked">Ask AI tools to write the program for you</li>
</ul>

While we agree that "vibe coding" is common in the industry,
but you are not ready to use these AI tools and judge the quality of their output
until you have a firm understanding of the fundemantals and extensive programming experiences.

Confirmed violations can result in receiving an "F" for this course.


## A Notice of Academic Accommodations from Disability and Access (D&A)
If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Disability and Access (D&A). You may refer to D&A’s website for contact and more information: [http://disability.utexas.edu/](http://disability.utexas.edu/). If you are already registered with D&A, please deliver your accommodation letter to me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations.
